# Pytorch-Cifar-models
This repository contains some famous CNN models that can run on the cifar-10 dataset
# Goal 
## For fast verification of new CNN model on cifar-10 data set 
You can just write a simple model.py in pytorch , this resposity is based the resiposity 
but modify all the hyper-parameters in configure file and command line for better experiments
